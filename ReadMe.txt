Server scripts should be run with python3 or higher.
1.	You can run the client.py in an ide or in on the command line using the following commands.
    In terminal type “python3 client.py” and hit Enter or run the file or run it in an IDE like PyCharm.
2.	The text sent to the terminal is already been preset so you do not have to worry about it.
3.	There are two port numbers you can use, however you will need to set them in the code with the variable
    labeled serverAddress to hit the specific ports. The example of the code is below.

    #Non Losseless Server
    #serveraddress = ("69.61.103.44", 7851)
    #Lossy Server
    serveraddress = ("69.61.103.44", 8591)
